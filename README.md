# RNN LM

In this assignment, you are provided with code that implements an RNN language model.

## Assignment

Your task is to implement these three extensions discussed in ยง7.8.4 of Neural Machine Translation by Philipp Koehn.
* Generate text
* Process batches
* Validation set

To do so, you will need to find the TODO items in the provided code, and implement them.


## Extra credit:
* Modify your code so that it runs on GPU instead of CPU.


## Logistics

* You should work on qivalluk.linguistics.illinois.edu

* Download the data:
  * make 

* Use the following python environment:
  * source /opt/python/3.7/venv/pytorch1.7_cuda10.1/bin/activate


## Tips

* Review Chapter 7 (Neural Language Models) of Neural Machine Translation by Philipp Koehn

* Use the Pytorch tutorials and documentation (and other online Pytorch tutorials)
